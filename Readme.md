# Readme

This repo is a simple demonstrator of reading KML files, and doing Point in Polygon Analysis.

The code reads the attached KML file, and creates Shapely Points from two sets of Lat-longs.
It then shows how you can use Shapely's contain function to check if the point is contained within the polygon.
